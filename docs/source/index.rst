Texable documentation
=====================

**Texable** is a Python library designed to make the generation of LaTeX tables simple, automated, and maintainable.

When working with LaTeX documents, manually updating tables as data changes can be tedious and error-prone. Texable solves this problem by allowing you to generate LaTeX tables programmatically, making it easy to update and reuse tables without touching the raw LaTeX code.
